                Long ago, there was this hackathon at Sunny Hills HS. So I decided to go.
                During that time, my favorite game was this resource management game called
                adarkroom. So naturally, I tried to create a game that would emulate it.

                So me and my friends from middle school decided to create a platformer game.
                Although we never finished, we got some progress before we could not continue
                due to schedule difficulties.
